            <h2><em>About me</em></h2>
                
            <p><br />I am a highly professional, determined and positive manager who takes the responsibilities that come with the role seriously. 
            I am a naturally driven person who has the interpersonal skills, the decisiveness and the ability to achieve tough targets and complete challenging projects whilst under pressure. 
            I understand that Amazon has only reached the status it has as the largest online retailer in the world by employing staff and managers who all work towards achieving the same goal. 
            Having studied the Amazon leadership principles in detail, I can assure you I have the necessary qualities and attributes to perform the role to a very high standard. 
            If you employ me as your manager, I will work extremely hard to ensure both myself and the team I am managing all work hard to ensure Amazon stays at the forefront of the industry.”</p>
              
            <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
            <p>As a Process Assistant with Amazon, I routinely deliver verbal and written communications to clearly and concisely respond to inquiries from associates as to support them in areas of improvement, proper techniques to increase their productivity rates, ensuring their quality metrics are meeting standards, 
            and while listening to their concerns to collaborate in a team driven environment to ensure that operational requirements are being met and exceeded. Within the Inventory Control, Quality Assurance department, it was important to engage with different stakeholders within the operations because it allowed us to maximize teamwork  -->
            and efficiencies by researching and pulling metrics from the floor and utilize that to identify areas that needs improvement through audits and maintaining a database or filing system to ensure historical data is available to produce reports, forms, and decisions to stakeholders. 
            My time at Amazon allowed me to organize and coordinate workflow processes in order to maintain consistent productivity levels, support decision making with my manager and other co-workers to prioritize tasks and workloads to ensure we are proposing solutions that reach out goals for optimal use of resources and labour hours, 
            and most important our associates receive the highest level of support.</p>
                
    
            <p>Working at the State Bank of Patiala, I meet all levels of people with different needs daily from old to young and ability to distinguish individual client’s needs such as people with disabilities and those living within fixed or low income such as seniors who rely on social assistance payments for daily living. 
            As an administrative assistant at Allan Teachman Accountant, working with clients and helping them find solutions to their cases was one of the best highlights of my job because it offers resolution on both sides to see clients happy and our overall reputation flourishing. 
            The OPS is one the top employers in Canada and MCSS has always been a fundamental pillar in Ontario to support communities and family services to across Ontario. I feel that my public facing, and operations experience can be invaluable for the ODSP team as a mother of a baby boy 
            and a team leader of hundreds of Amazon associates for Ontarians with disability and in need of social assistance in times of COVID-19 when personal finances can be tough</p>
